Learn about Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) through implementation of the classic game of Connect Four

Overview of Transformer Architecture for Connect Four
Input Representation:

The game board state can be represented as a 42-dimensional vector (flattened board).
Each element in this vector represents a cell in the Connect Four grid, which can be empty, contain a player’s disc, or the opponent’s disc.
Positional Encoding:

Since Transformers need to understand the order of moves, positional encodings will be added to the input vector to provide a sense of position in the sequence.
Transformer Encoder:

Multiple layers of the Transformer encoder will be used to process the input sequence. Each layer consists of a multi-head self-attention mechanism followed by a feed-forward network.
Output Layer:

The output of the Transformer encoder will be passed through a final linear layer to produce the Q-values for each possible action (columns 0-6).
Hyperparameters:

Number of layers: Number of Transformer encoder layers.
Number of heads: Number of attention heads in each multi-head attention layer.
Embedding dimension: Size of the input and output embeddings.
Feed-forward dimension: Size of the feed-forward network hidden layers.
Dropout rate: Dropout rate for regularization.




Overview of the Agent Learning Process
Single-Agent Self-Play
In the current setup, a single agent is learning to play Connect Four through self-play. Here’s a breakdown of how the agent takes turns and learns:

Self-Play:

The agent plays against itself by alternating turns.
For each move, the agent treats the board state as its current state and decides the best action to take based on its policy (Q-values).
After each action, the game environment updates the state, and the agent records the resulting new state, the action taken, the reward received, and whether the game has ended (done).
Replay Buffer:

Experiences (state, action, reward, next state, done) are stored in a replay buffer.
During training, batches of experiences are sampled from the replay buffer to update the agent's policy.
Q-Learning Update:

The agent uses Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQN) to update its Q-values.
For each sampled experience, the target Q-value is computed using the reward and the maximum Q-value of the next state.
The loss between the predicted Q-value and the target Q-value is minimized using backpropagation.
Turn-Taking
State Representation: Each state is represented as a flattened board (42 elements).
Action Selection: The agent selects an action based on the Q-values predicted for the current state. The action corresponds to one of the seven possible columns where a disc can be dropped.
Environment Update: The environment updates the board state based on the selected action, switches the turn to the other player (which is the same agent in self-play), and checks for the game’s end conditions.
Exploration and Exploitation
Exploration and exploitation are crucial for the agent to learn effectively. Here’s how these concepts are managed:

Exploration:

The agent explores the environment by taking random actions with a certain probability (epsilon).
This helps the agent discover new strategies and avoid getting stuck in suboptimal policies.
Exploitation:

The agent exploits its learned policy by selecting the action with the highest Q-value.
This helps the agent maximize its reward based on its current knowledge.
Epsilon Decay:

Epsilon starts at a high value, meaning the agent explores more at the beginning of training.
Epsilon decays exponentially over time, leading to more exploitation as training progresses.
This balance allows the agent to explore sufficiently early on and exploit its learned knowledge as it improves.




Basics of Transformers
Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that have been particularly successful in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but they are also applicable to other domains. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

Self-Attention Mechanism:

Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different elements in the input sequence relative to each other. For each element in the sequence, it calculates attention scores with all other elements.
This mechanism helps capture long-range dependencies and relationships within the input data.
Multi-Head Attention:

Instead of calculating a single set of attention scores, multi-head attention computes multiple sets of attention scores (heads) in parallel. Each head can focus on different parts of the input, allowing the model to learn different aspects of the relationships in the data.
Positional Encoding:

Since transformers do not inherently understand the order of elements in a sequence (unlike RNNs), positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide information about the position of each element in the sequence.
Feed-Forward Networks:

After the attention layers, the data is passed through feed-forward neural networks to further process the information.
Layer Normalization and Residual Connections:

Each attention and feed-forward layer is followed by layer normalization and residual connections, which help stabilize and speed up training.
Transformers in Reinforcement Learning (RL)
In RL, particularly in the DDQN context, transformers can be used to process sequential data or state representations. Here’s how they integrate:

State Representation:

In Connect Four, the board state can be represented as a sequence of features. The transformer processes this sequence to extract relevant information about the state.
Q-Value Prediction:

The output of the transformer is used to predict Q-values for each possible action. These Q-values represent the expected future rewards for taking each action in the given state.
How Transformers Fit into DDQN
In your Connect Four training model, the transformer serves as the feature extractor, while the DDQN algorithm handles the learning and updating of Q-values. Here’s how the components work together:

State Processing with Transformer:

The current state (board configuration) is passed through the transformer to extract high-level features. The transformer outputs a representation of the state.
Q-Value Computation:

The output of the transformer is passed through a linear layer to compute Q-values for all possible actions (dropping a disc in each column).
Action Selection (Exploration vs. Exploitation):

An action is selected based on the Q-values using an epsilon-greedy policy. With probability epsilon, a random action is chosen (exploration), and with probability (1 - epsilon), the action with the highest Q-value is chosen (exploitation).
Experience Replay and DDQN Update:

The agent’s experiences (state, action, reward, next state, done) are stored in a replay buffer.
During training, batches of experiences are sampled from the replay buffer.
The target Q-value is computed using the Bellman equation, and the transformer-based Q-network is updated to minimize the difference between predicted and target Q-values.
Detailed Explanation of the Transformer Components
Embedding Layer:

Converts the board state from its original form (a 42-element vector) to a higher-dimensional embedding space.
Positional Encoding:

Adds positional information to the embeddings, helping the transformer understand the order of elements in the sequence.
Transformer Encoder:

Processes the embeddings using self-attention and feed-forward layers to capture relationships and dependencies within the state.
Output Layer:

Maps the transformed representation to Q-values for each possible action.
