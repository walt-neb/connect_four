# Connect Four Reinforcement Learning Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing and testing reinforcement learning (RL) agents on the Connect Four game, a simple yet well-understood environment. The primary goal is to explore different aspects of reinforcement learning, including agent training, hyperparameter tuning, and the efficacy of various neural network configurations in a controlled setting.

## Project Objectives
- **Learning and Testing RL Agents**: Utilize the Connect Four game to train and evaluate RL agents, providing a clear demonstration of learning capabilities and strategy development.
- **Configurability**: Facilitate easy modification of hyperparameters, neural network layers, optimizers, and other RL configurations to study their impacts on agent performance.
- **Graphical Enhancement**: Future updates aim to integrate this project into a graphical environment such as TensorFlow Playground, allowing for more interactive visualization and experimentation.

## Setup
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/connect-four-rl.git
cd connect-four-rl

2. **Install Requirements**:
Ensure you have Python installed, and then install the required packages:


3. **Run the Simulation**:
Execute the main script to start training the agents:

python train.py

python play.py [trained_agent]

## Usage
- **Training the Agent**: The `train.py` script runs the training sessions for the RL agents, automatically adjusting according to the defined hyperparameters.
- **Adjusting Parameters**: Modify the parameters in `config.py` (to be implemented) to tweak the training process and neural network architecture.
- **Visualization**: Use the provided visualization tools in `visualization.py` (to be implemented) to observe the agent's performance and decision-making process.

## Future Directions
- **Hyperparameter Tuning Interface**: Develop a GUI or command-line interface for easier manipulation and testing of different training configurations.
- **Integration with TensorFlow Playground**: Enhance the project to support a graphical web-based environment for broader accessibility and interactive learning experiences.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome! You can contribute by:
- Expanding the neural network configurations.
- Adding new features or improvements in the simulation environment.
- Enhancing the documentation or creating tutorials.

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
